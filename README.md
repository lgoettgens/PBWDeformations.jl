# PBWDeformations.jl Julia package

## Install

To install this package in Julia:
```
using Pkg; Pkg.add("PBWDeformations")
```

## Functionality

The package will provide both a general framework and specialized functions in order to
- classify PBW deformations of certain smash products and
- study their representations.

To solve classification problems efficiently, we use representation theoretic ideas.


## Basic usage

Please consult the [example jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/lgoettgens/PBWDeformations.jl/master/examples/PBWDeformationsNotebook.ipynb) for v0.3.
We expect some more in-depth documentation to be found at some point in future at [https://lgoettgens.github.io/PBWDeformations.jl/](https://lgoettgens.github.io/PBWDeformations.jl/).
